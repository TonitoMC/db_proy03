# Hospital Staff Reporting

This project was made as part of a Relational Databases University course, it's objective was to make a simple reporting application where the reports are
calculated in real-time. This means, all of the information processing, grouping, filtering, etc. is done by dynamically building queries sent to a PostgreSQL database.
We were also tasked with building a frontend, allowing the user of the application to see the reports, visualize via graphs, export to PDF & CSV.
